## Hi, I'm Chinonso 👋

🔭 I recently created an economic opportunity mapping tool in collaboration with Girls Who Code that uses geospatial data to visualize access to unemployment resource centers and microfinance insitutions in emerging markets to identify opportunities for directing future development investment

🌱 As a Break Through Tech student, I learned how to engineer a predictive analytics algorithm that generates trade recommendations via predicting future stock prices and market trends by analyzing public financial, economic, and company specfic data
