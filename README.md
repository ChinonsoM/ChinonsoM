## Hi, I'm Chinonso ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ I recently created an economic opportunity mapping tool with Girls Who Code that uses geospatial data in Africa to visualizes access to unemployment resource centers and microfinance insitutions in emerging markets to identify opportunities for most effectively increasing future growth.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to create a predictive analytics algorithm that generates trade recommendations by forecasting future stock prices and market trends from large sets of financial, economic, and company specfic data.
