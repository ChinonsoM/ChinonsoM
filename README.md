## Hi, I'm Chinonso ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ I recently created an economic opportunity mapping tool with Girls Who Code that uses geospatial data in emerging markets to visualize access to unemployment resource centers and microfinance insitutions in Africa to identify opportunities for directing future development

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to create a predictive analytics algorithm that generates trade recommendations by forecasting future stock prices and market trends from large sets of financial, economic, and company specfic data
