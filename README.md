## Hi, I'm Chinonso 👋

🔭 I recently created an economic opportunity mapping tool in collaboration with Girls Who Code that uses geospatial data to visualize access to unemployment resource centers and microfinance insitutions in emerging markets to identify opportunities for directing future development investment

🌱 As a Break Through Tech student, I engineered a predictive analytics algorithm with Cashew Capital hedge fund that generates trade recommendations by forecasting future stock prices and market trends from analyzing public financial, economic, and company specfic data on equities
